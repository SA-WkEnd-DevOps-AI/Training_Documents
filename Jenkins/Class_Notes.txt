	Build Orchestration Tool - Jenkins
	
	Jenkins :::
	
	Continuous Development & Continuous Integration ::::
	
		Using DevOps Approach ::
			Developers :
			-- Create Application Source Code 
			-- Commit the Source Code to Source Code Repository like github
			
			Using DevOps Process :
			Automate ::

			- Build the code - Compile and create artifacts 					
			- Unit Testing 					
			- Promote the Application to higher testing Environment					
			- Notify the Testing/Development Team 	

		Tools :::
		
			- Eclipse based IDEs - like Eclipse for Java,Pycharm,Intellij, Visual Studio, Visual Studio Code
			- Source Code Management Tool - like github/AWS Code Commit/Azure Repos 
			- Jenkins/AzurePipeline/AWS CodeBuild/gitlab-ci/bamboo/github-actions
			
			
	Environment:
	
		Dev 
			Create Source Code!							--> Eclipse/GIT/GITHUB
			
		Build 
			use the code in build enviroment			--> Git 
			build - compile								--> maven
			create artitfacts							--> maven
			unit test 									--> maven,junit
			promote the artifacts to Test environment   --> Ansible/Deployment plugins/SSH
		
		Test 
			Automated QA Testing 						--> TestNG,Selenium
			Generate Test Reports 						--> TestNG,Selenium	
			Validated Test Results 						--> TestNG,Selenium
			promote the artifacts to Prod environment	--> Ansible/Deployment plugins/SSH 	
	
	

	What is Jenkins :::
	
		Jenkins is Open-Source Build Orchestration Tool.
		Used to Automate the End-to-End Application Build and Deployments
		Using Jenkins we can create CI/CD Pipelines 
		
	Jenkins Architecture ::
	
		Jenkins is based on Master-Slave Architecture :::
		
			Jenkins_Master (VM)				==> Install Jenkins - To Create Jenkins CI/CD Pipeline Jobs/Projects
				Jenkins_SlaveNode1 (VM)		==> Perform Application Builds - compile/create artifacts
						
						
		At Enterprise level :::
		
			Java Applications 
			.Net Applications
			Python Applications 



		Scenario1 :	Application Build and Release frequency is very less.
		
			Jenkins_Master (VM) 	==> Create Jenkins CI/CD Pipeline Projects & Execute the Build in same Jenkins_Master Node.
			
			
		Scenario2 : Muliple Applications with high Build and Release frequencies.
			
			Jenkins_Master (VM)			==> To Create Jenkins CI/CD Pipeline Projects and schedule to the builds in the slave_nodes
																	
				Jenkins_SlaveNode1 (VM)	==> Perform Application Builds - Java Applications 
				Jenkins_SlaveNode2 (VM)	==> Perform Application Builds - .Net Applications			
				Jenkins_SlaveNode3 (VM)	==> Perform Application Builds - Python Applications 
				Jenkins_SlaveNode4 (VM)	==> Perform Application Builds - Angular/NodeJS
				Jenkins_SlaveNode5 (VM)	==> Perform Application Builds - Ruby 
				
	CI/CD Workflow :::
	
		SCM_Checkout 
		Application Build 
		Unit Testing 
		Create Artifacts 
		Promote the Application to Test Environments
		Notify 
		Deploy to Prod

Day 7 : 29th June 2025 
#######################	

	Build Orchestration using Jenkins!
	
	Maintain excel sheet to document any error/issues faced during practise.
	
	
	Working with Jenkins :
	
	- Developers' Perspectives :
	
		- Developers are just the consumers of Jenkins using Jenkins Tools and Services.
		- Developers use Jenkins to execute/cancel/view the output - workspace of the Jenkins projects/Pipelines/Jobs.
		
	- DevOps Perspectives:
		
		- DevOps Team is the owner of Jenkins.		
		
		- Roles & Responsibilities of DevOps Team/Resources :
		
		- Jenkins Administration :
		
			- Installation of Jenkins 
			- Global System Configurations
			- Plugins Management 
			- Tools Management 
			- User Management
			- Security Management 
			- Credential Management
			- Create Jenkins Projects in Jenkins Master Node
			- Configuration and Management of Jenkins Master/Slave Architecture
			- Create CICD Pipeline Projects/Jobs to Automate Application Builds and Deployments
			- Onboard the Applications to CI/CD Process
			- Jenkins Server - Periodic Backup for Recovery
			- Periodic Upgrade of Jenkins Server and the plugins
			- Trouble-shooting any Jenkins related issues
			
	
	
	- Installation of Jenkins :::	
	
		- Ubuntu Machine - 22.04v AMI
		- Install Jenkins.
		
			- Jenkins Package run as a service using default port 8080
				- It can be execute using Web-Browser
				
				
		https://www.jenkins.io/doc/book/installing/
		
		https://www.jenkins.io/doc/book/installing/linux/
		
		- Pre-Requisites
		- Installation of Jenkins 
		- Post-Installation Activities 
		
		- Upon Installation :
		
			Access Jenkins Dashboard.
			
	- Global System Configurations :
	
	
	- Plugins Management :
	
	
	- Tools Management :
	
	
	- User Management : Enable User Authentication
	
	
	- Security Management :	Enable User Authorization
	
	
	- Credential Management : 
	
	
	- Create Jenkins Projects in Jenkins Master Node :
	
		-> Free-Style Projects 
		
				- Completely Manual - configured using Jenkins Dashboard/Web-Interface 
				
				
				Jenkins Variables :
				
					- Environment Variables 		# Reserved Jenkins Key-words
													# meant of each job.
													
						"jenkins-${JOB_NAME}-${BUILD_NUMBER}"
						
						"${var1}"		# Syntax to use variables 
						
						
					
					
					- User-Defined Variables.		# Created by the users to parameterize the Jobs.
				
				
				
							x = 5 
				
		
		-> Pipeline Projects :
	
				- Completely Automated - configured using Jenkins Pipeline Scripts - Groovy
				- Create Pipeline Project Templates to onboard any application.
				
				
				- Two Types of Jenkins Pipelines :
				
					- Scripted Pipelines 
					
					- Declarative Pipelines 	# Simplified version of Scripted Pipelines.
												# Script/Snippet Generator - used to generate scripts.
	CI/CD Workflow :::
	
		SCM_Checkout 
		Application Build 
		Unit Testing 
		Create Artifacts 
		Promote the Application to Test Environments
		Notify 
		Deploy to Prod 


		
pipeline {
    agent any

    stages {
        stage('SCM_Checkout') {
            steps {
                echo 'Perform SCM_Checkout'
            }
        }
        stage('Application_Build') {
            steps {
                echo 'Perform Application Build'
				sh 'echo "Hello"'
            }
        }
        stage('Deploy to Test Server') {
            steps {
                echo 'Perform QA Deployment'
            }
        }
    }
}


Jenkins Pipelines composed of various stages
